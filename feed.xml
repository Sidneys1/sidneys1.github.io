<h2 id="getting-started-with-jekyll">Getting Started With Jekyll</h2>

<p>I use a Windows PC, and I find that the Jekyll environment is easier to set up under the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>, so that’s what I’ll be using going
forward in this post. First, we’ll install Ruby via your package manager - Ubuntu 20.04 has Ruby 2.7 available on apt
via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apt install ruby</code>. Next we’ll use the Ruby package manager, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem</code> to install both Jekyll and Bundler:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install bundler jekyll</code>. Finally, you can create a new Jekyll site with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll new sitename</code>.</p>

<p>Once inside the new site folder, you can generate and serve your page with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll serve</code>! This will create
a development server on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://localhost:4000</code>. Let’s quickly talk about how Jekyll works:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You create Markdown or HTML files in your site’s folder for each post you wish to make.</li>
  <li>Jekyll processes these files (along with some templates - we’ll get to these later) to generate static HTML files.</li>
  <li>These static HTML files (in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site</code>) are what you want to put on your web hosting! It’s all static, so you don’t need
anything fancy like server-side PHP or client-side Angular or React.</li>
</ol>

<p>To simplify the build-preview and build-release process, let’s make a simple Makefile. GNU Make is a tool that allows
you to define simple build steps, and then figures out the interdependencies between these steps for you. Let’s take
a look:</p>

<div class="language-make highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nl">all</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nf">build</span>

<span class="nl">build</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nf">_site/</span>

<span class="nl">serve</span><span class="o">:</span>
	bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>jekyll serve <span class="nt">--watch</span> <span class="nt">--livereload</span> <span class="nt">--force_polling</span> <span class="nt">--drafts</span> <span class="nt">--destination</span> _site_live/

<span class="nl">_site/</span><span class="o">:</span>
	<span class="nb">env </span><span class="nv">JEKYLL_ENV</span><span class="o">=</span>production bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>jekyll build

<span class="nl">clean</span><span class="o">:</span>
	<span class="nb">rm</span> <span class="nt">-rf</span> _site/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s break down each of these sections:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">all: build</code>: “all” is the default rule run when you execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make</code>. This line says when “all” is run, run “build”
first.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">build: _site/</code>: when the “build” rule is run, we depend on “_site/” being built first.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">serve: ...</code>: If you execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make serve</code>, this rule is triggered. Make will run the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll serve ...</code>
command we’ve listed. The parameters included are:
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--watch</code>: live-rebuild any changes made to the posts as you edit them (very useful!).</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--livereload</code>: use LiveReload to automatically refresh your browser when changes are rebuilt.</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--force_polling</code>: this is a workaround for some WSL bugs. See
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/216">this WSL issue</a>.</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--drafts</code>: include posts under the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_drafts</code> folder (this is where you can put in-progress posts).</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--destination _site_live/</code>: this directs the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">serve</code> command to build the static output under a separate folder
than the normal <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site/</code> rule. This way we can’t accidentally publish our live preview version of the website - if
we did, it would be broken because all links would lead to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">localhost</code> instead of your website’s URL!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site/: ...</code>: this rule matches a file path, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site</code>, which is Jekyll’s output folder. Make understands file paths
and will know that this rule will build the contents of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site</code>. Note that we use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">env</code> to tell Jekyll to use the
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/environments/">“production” environment</a>.</p>

    <p>We’ll never run this rule manually (though you could with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make _site/</code>), but our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">build</code> rule depends on this
running, and so Make will automatically run it when needed.</p>
  </li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clean: ...</code>: Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make clean</code> to invoke this rule - in our case, we just delete the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site/</code> folder.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="modifying-the-jekyll-configuration">Modifying the Jekyll Configuration</h2>

<p>Jekyll configuration is stored in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file at the root of our site. There are a couple things in here
we’ll want to adjust before we publish our site to the world wide web. First of course we’ll want to set a few basics:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code>: The name of your site (shown in the header).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">email</code>: A contact email address (shown in the footer).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">url</code>: This one is important - this sets the url used when clicking on absolute links to other pages within your site!</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">baseurl</code>: Used in conjunction with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">url</code>. The format used is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{url}{baseurl}/path/to/page.html</code>. If you’re hosting
nothing but Jekyll on your website, then leave this blank.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s about it! We’ll dig into configuration more when we talk about hosting on Tor and IPFS.</p>

<h2 id="hosting">Hosting</h2>

<p>Ok! Now that we have a (basic) site, how do we host it? Let’s start simple and look at NearlyFreeSpeech.net, whom I’ve
been using for years. They’re cheap, no-nonsense, and don’t have any crazy hidden fees. They also have support for Let’s
Encrypt certificates, making SSL support both easy and automatic. Head on over and set up an account. It’ll walk you
through creating a site (your website hosting) and you can even register and connect the domain name all within their
system. Eventually you’ll find the settings to be able to connect with SSH - enable this and let’s update our Makefile
again. Add this rule to your Makefile:</p>

<div class="language-make highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nl">publish</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nf">_site/</span>
	rsync <span class="nt">--itemize-changes</span> <span class="nt">--checksum</span> <span class="nt">--recursive</span> <span class="nt">--compress</span> <span class="nt">--delete</span> _site/<span class="k">*</span> <span class="nv">$USER</span>@ssh.phx.nearlyfreespeech.net:.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s break it down again:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">publish: _site/</code>: when we execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make publish</code>, we want to make sure the rule to build the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site/</code> folder runs
first.</li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rsync [...] _site/* $USER@ssh.phx.nearlyfreespeech.net:.</code>: we’ll use rsync (a remote file-copying tool) to connect to
our hosting via SSH, synchronizing the contents of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site</code> with the root (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.</code>) folder of our hosting. You’ll want to
replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$USER</code> with your NearlyFreeSpeech.net username, of course.</p>

    <p>The options we’re using are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--itemize-changes</code>: list changes as we go (for clarity).</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--checksum</code>: rely on a file checksum (not timestamps and file size) to determine if files need to be replaced.</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--recursive</code>: recurse into subdirectories of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site/</code>.</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--compress</code>: HTML is very compressible, so why not save some bandwidth?</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--delete</code>: this allows rsync to remove files on your hosting that are no longer present in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site</code> folder.
This can be useful if you rename or delete a file that you no longer want people to be able to access.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make publish</code> now should build your website and then prompt your for your NearlyFreeSpeech.net password to
connect with SSH. Provide your password and watch as your site is made available!</p>

Since this is the first
year I started collecting retro computers, it will also contain a few items that I’ve had for over a year as well.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="commodore-64">Commodore 64</h2>

<p>That’s right! The O.G. home computer, and still the best-selling single model of computer to date. My particular model
is a brown breadbin.</p>

<h3 id="commodore-1541-disk-drive">Commodore 1541 Disk Drive</h3>

<p>Included with my C64 was a Commodore 1541 5.25” floppy disk drive. Not too much to say here.</p>

<h3 id="games-and-software">Games and Software</h3>

<p>I also received a few 5.25” disks with the C64, however I can’t locate them at this moment. I’ll have to see if I can
find them and then update this post.</p>

<h3 id="line-doubler">Line Doubler</h3>

<p>My initial attempts at connecting the C64 up to a modern television were not great - eventually I ordered a cheap line
doubler that accepted breakout RGB input and produced HDMI. I’m honestly unimpressed with this particular model (Amanka
AVI to HDMI) and instead ended up buying a S-Video cable for the C64 and using a CRT television instead - the difference
in picture quality is astounding.</p>

<h3 id="iec2microsd">IEC2MicroSD</h3>

<p>Another convenience purchase, this device allows me to use an SD card as if it were a floppy drive.</p>

<h2 id="commodore-vic-20">Commodore VIC-20</h2>

<p>A more recent purchase, I also acquired a Commodore VIC-20 (revision A or B board). You can see
<a href="https://cbmvic.net/registry/569">my entry on the VIC-20 registry</a>. This VIC currently powers on, but does not output a
video signal. I’m in the processes of figuring out what the problem is. It’s in pretty rough shape, with a few damaged
parts on the case and missing the metallic Commodore VIC-20 badge (of which I’ve ordered a replacement).</p>

<p>This computer came in the original box, amazingly, and included the power adapter (actually soldered on to the
mainboard), several manuals, and the “Invaders” cartridge.</p>

<h2 id="sun-sparcstation-haul">Sun SPARCstation Haul</h2>

<p>Wow - what can I say here? A few months ago I had a reply to a <a href="https://www.freecycle.org/">FreeCycle</a> listing that I’d
posted in search of any early-90’s to late-00’s computers (this search also turned up the Dell CRT described below).
The person who messaged me had been a small businessowner in the early to mid 90’s, and was looking to get rid of some
of their server room equipment that they’d been holding on to in a storage unit. I hastily agreed and a few months later
I went to pick up quite the haul:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A WYSE CRT Serial Terminal</li>
  <li>A Nokia 447W CRT Monitor</li>
  <li>A Sun Microsystems PS/2 keyboard</li>
  <li>A Compaq Netelligent 100Base-T Class 1 Repeater</li>
  <li>A Dell PowerEdge 650 (this is from 2003, so much later in the company’s lifetime than the majority of this equipment)</li>
  <li>An unlabeled beige PC tower (still need to look inside this one!)</li>
  <li>A Dell PowerEdge 1300 (also circa late 90’s early 00’s)</li>
  <li>An unknown rack-mount box with a “CTC” badge, locking front panel, and perhaps a LCD display (also need to crack this
one open!)</li>
  <li>An Axil Ultima 1 (a third-party Sun SPARCstation Clone, see <a href="https://fcw.com/1996/06/axil-targets-sun-with-sparc-compatible-graphics-computer/238823/">this article</a>)</li>
  <li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation_20">Sun SPARCstation 20</a></li>
  <li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_1">Sun ULTRA 1 Creator</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="compaq-deskpro-retro-battlestation">Compaq DeskPro Retro Battlestation</h2>

<p>Another longer-term effort of mine has been to recreate my childhood computer - a Compaq DeskPro that sat on the desk
under my loft bed through most of my formative years. Of course, since we have the benefit of choice, I’m also
“upgrading” it into the ideal late-90’s gaming computer!</p>

<p>The exact model I have is a later model DeskPro EN that is quite a bit smaller in overall form factor to my childhood
PC, however it does have the same general aesthetics that I was looking for. Unfortunately, so far I’ve been unable to
locate the matching Compaq keyboard and 800x600 CRT that I had as a kid as well… Though I did find a period-correct
Compaq PS/2 mouse!</p>

<h3 id="geforce-fx5200">GeForce FX5200</h3>

<p>I acquired a GeForce fx5200 PCI GPU for this computer - I originally had purchased a AGP 5200 by accident, so I suppose
I’ll end up using that in some other computer down the line!</p>

<p>This card works quite well (once the appropriate DirectX 9 drivers are installed) in all of the games I’ve tested so
far.</p>

<h3 id="microsoft-naturals-keyboard">Microsoft Naturals Keyboard</h3>

<p>A flea market find - a $5 Microsoft Naturals keyboard - a funky little beige PS/2 keyboard with an early PS/2→USB
adapter. In lieu of the Compaq keyboard I really want, this works in a pinch.</p>

<h3 id="windows-98-second-edition-third-edition">Windows 98 Second Edition <em>(Third Edition?)</em></h3>

<p>Finally, this computer runs Windows 98 SE with many components of the unofficial “third edition” service pack installed
to add some much-needed quality-of-life features, including USB mass storage device support.</p>

<h3 id="dell-monitor">Dell Monitor</h3>

<p>Not much to say here, another FreeCycle find - while it does support a nice 1024x768 resolution, it has a mid-00’s black
plastic aesthetic that I am not overly fond of.</p>

<h2 id="compaq-presario-700">Compaq Presario 700</h2>

<p>An EBay purchase, this is a early-00’s laptop designed for use with Windows XP. Being from GoodWill it came without an
internal hard drive, which I’ve since replaced. Interestingly, it includes an expansion slot, a 3.5” floppy drive, <em>and</em>
a DVD-ROM and CD R-RW drive.</p>

<h2 id="compaq-presario-1245">Compaq Presario 1245</h2>

<p>Another EBay purchase, this time a slightly older aesthetic laptop with a CD-ROM only drive and a floppy drive.</p>

<h2 id="dell-inspiron-1420">Dell Inspiron 1420</h2>

<p>This is my childhood laptop! Which now probably counts as “retro”. Not much to say here, there are a few missing keys
because I once decided to try the DVORAK layout (which I got quite good at as I remember), but as it turns out Dell
in its infinite wisdom made the indexing keys (F and J) use a reversed butterfly hinge from the rest of the keys,
meaning those didn’t <em>quite</em> fit in the alternate layout an I had to physically cut them to make them fit. Eventually
this physical damage led to them no attaching to the hinge as securely as they should have, and with time a few keys
became lost entirely.</p>]]></content><author><name>Sidneys1</name></author><category term="retrocomputing" /><category term="retrocomputing" /><category term="collecting" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here’s a quick roundup of the retrocomputing projects I worked on and devices I’ve acquired!

one myself. But with that dream accompanied another thought: <em>raytracers are nearly a pure expression of math</em>, a
discipline I am poorly qualified for.</p>

<p>However this winter I discovered a new programming community, <a href="https://community.onelonecoder.com/">OneLoneCoder</a>, and its leader, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA">javidx9</a>.
Watching the videos produced by javidx9 inspired me to take a leap of faith in myself and start this raytracing project.
The result has been amazing to see unfold as I developed first a working prototype in C#, then in C++, and finally as I
produced what hopefully is an easy to follow “tutorial” style Git repository. So, lets dive in!</p>

<h2 id="what-is-raytracing">What is Raytracing?</h2>

<p>Raytracing is a method of rendering three dimensional scenes that is inspired by the physics behind light and vision. In
the real world, light emanates from some source and bounces off of objects before entering our eye and being processed
by the brain. In raytracing, however, this process is reversed, and a “ray” is sent out from the virtual camera into a
scene, collecting information about the objects it encounters, eventually returning a resolved color for that pixel of
the canvas.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-we-begin">How Do We Begin?</h2>

<h3 id="creating-a-new-olcpixelgameengine-project">Creating a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">olc::PixelGameEngine</code> Project</h3>

<p>We’re going to start with <kbd>Create a new project</kbd> in Visual Studio (I’m using 2022). Select the <kbd>Empty
Project</kbd> (C++/Windows/Console) template. I also opted for the flat directory structure option <kbd>☑ Place solution
and project in the same directory</kbd>.</p>

<p><img src="https://sidneys1.github.io/images/2022-03-23-raytracing/create-a-new-project.png" alt="Create new project" /></p>

<p>We copy in the <a href="https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine/releases/latest/download/olcPixelGameEngine.h"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">olcPixelGameEngine.h</code> file</a> and add it to our solution. We also add a blank <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.cpp</code>
and populate it with the contents of the template available in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">olcPixelGameEngine.h</code> header, taking care to rename
our game class to match our needs.</p>

<div class="note">
  <div class="note-title">Note</div>
  <p>Running our project will render a default PixelGameEngine scene: a 256x240 canvas of random pixels, magnified 4x:</p>

  <div class="popunder">
	<img class="pop" src="https://sidneys1.github.io/images/2022-03-23-raytracing/rainbow.png" alt="Pixel Barf" title="Pixel Barf" onclick="document.getElementById('pixel-barf').showModal()" />
	<em>Click to zoom.</em>
</div>

  <dialog class="popover" id="pixel-barf">

	<img class="pop-in" src="/images/2022-03-23-raytracing/rainbow.png" alt="Pixel Barf" title="Pixel Barf" onclick="document.getElementById('pixel-barf').close()" />
</dialog>

</div>

<h2 id="setting-the-scene">Setting the Scene</h2>

<h3 id="add-basic-shapes-and-a-vector-of-shapes-to-render">Add basic Shapes and a vector of shapes to render</h3>

<p>We create a base class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shape</code> and derived class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sphere</code> (blank for now) that we will use to define our renderable
objects in the future.</p>

<p>We also add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::vector</code> of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::unique_ptr&lt;Shape&gt;</code> to our game class. This will allow us to add new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shape</code>-derived
objects to our scene:</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">shapes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">emplace_back</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">std</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">make_unique</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Sphere</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">());</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When the game exits, the memory we allocated will be freed (thanks, smart pointers).</p>

<h3 id="add-constants-and-a-way-to-sample-single-pixels">Add constants and a way to “Sample” single pixels</h3>

<p>We define a few constants for window geometry and begin implementing our rendering process by looping over the rows and
columns of the scene and calling a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sample</code> function that takes a floating-point x,y position on the viewport and

<p>We’ll also give the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sphere</code> class a notion of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">radius</code>, which is not shared by all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shape</code>-derived classes:</p>

<span class="p">};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, we’ll want to update our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OnUserCreate</code> function to pass in the newly required properties of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sphere</code>. Let’s
create our initial <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sphere</code> at the position <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x=0, y=0, z=200</code>, where \(x\) is lateral position, \(y\) is vertical
position, and \(z\) is depth (or distance from the camera). Since our camera will be at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x=0, y=0, z=0</code> this will
align our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sphere</code> in the center of the canvas, 200 units away. We’ll also give our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sphere</code> a solid <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">olc::GREY</code> color,
and set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">radius</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">100</code>.</p>

<div class="language-diff highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gd">- shapes.emplace_back(std::make_unique&lt;Sphere&gt;());

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, using our newly created <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ray</code> type, let’s construct a ray in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sample</code> for a given pixel that will point into
the scene:</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Create a ray casting into the scene from this "pixel".</span>

<span class="c1">// TODO: We now need to test if this ray hits any Shapes and produces</span>
<span class="c1">//       a color.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We create the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ray</code> at origin <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x=x, y=y, z=0</code>, and set the direction to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x=0, y=0, z=1</code>. The direction is what we call a
<em>unit vector</em>, which means that the overall magnitude to the vector is 1 (\(\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}=1\)). Using a unit vector
will simplify some math for us later.</p>

<h3 id="add-fog-color-and-a-way-to-sample-rays">Add fog color and a way to sample rays</h3>

<p>To prevent our scene from extending into infinity, and to have something to show when a ray doesn’t hit <em>anything</em>, we
add a new constant: a “fog” color.</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// A color representing scene fog.</span>

<p>Additionally, we add a more specific function, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SampleRay</code>, that is called by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sample</code> to return the color (or absence
thereof) of a ray as it extends into our scene. For now, still, this returns a color relative to the \(x\) and \(y\)

<p>We’ll need to overload some operators for a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vf3d</code>: subtraction, and dot-product. A dot-product is a useful way of
comparing two vectors to determine if they are similar. Consider two vectors, \(a\) and \(b\). The dot-product is a
scalar value determined like so:</p>

\[dot(a,b) = a\cdot{}b = a_{1}b_{1}+a_{2}b_{2}+a_{3}b_{3}\]

<p>So, for example:</p>

\[\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\end{bmatrix}\cdot\begin{bmatrix} 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6\end{bmatrix}\newline=\newline(1\cdot4)+(2\cdot5)+(3\cdot6)\newline=\newline4+10+18\newline=\newline32\]

<h3 id="add-perspective-rendering-and-depth-sorting">Add perspective rendering and depth sorting</h3>

<p>First we’ll add some additional Spheres to our scene at different Z-depths. If we run our project now, you’ll see that
the Spheres added to our scene last are drawn in front of the earlier ones, even if they are further away.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://sidneys1.github.io/images/2022-03-23-raytracing/bad-z.png" alt="Bad Z-depth" /></p>

<p>To remedy that, we up date our hit check in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SampleRay</code> to select the object whose intersection is nearest to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ray</code>
origin. Now if we run our project, the Spheres are properly sorted.</p>

<div class="language-diff highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gd">- if (std::optional&lt;float&gt; distance = (*it)-&gt;intersection(r)) {
</span><span class="gi">+ if (std::optional&lt;float&gt; distance = (*it)-&gt;intersection(r).value_or(INFINITY);
+                 distance &lt; intersection_distance) {
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://sidneys1.github.io/images/2022-03-23-raytracing/no-perspective.png" alt="no-perspective" /></p>

<p>However, you’ll notice that all three Spheres are the same size, despite being different distances from the camera. To
fix <em>this</em>, we’ll need to add perspective to our camera. We’ll do this in a very simplistic manner, by having all of the
rays originate from some point, and pointing towards what you can think of as a “virtual canvas” some distance in front
of that origin point. Update <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sample</code> like so:</p>

<div class="language-diff highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gd">- ray sample_ray({ x, y, 0 }, { 0, 0, 1 });
</span><span class="gi">+ ray sample_ray({ 0, 0, -800 }, { (x / (float)WIDTH) * 100, (y / (float)HEIGHT) * 100, 200});
</span>
  // Sample this ray - if the ray doesn't hit anything, use the color of
  // the surrounding fog.
<span class="gd">- return SampleRay(sample_ray).value_or(FOG);
</span><span class="gi">+ return SampleRay(sample_ray.normalize()).value_or(FOG);
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice we call method of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ray</code> that we haven’t defined yet: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">normalize()</code>. Normalization produces a normalized vector
(discussed before) from a non-normalized vector by resizing the vector components in proportion to their length such
that the overall length is still 1. Normalization is defined as (with \(v\cdot{}v\) of course being the dot product of
itself):</p>

\[normalize(v) = \frac{v}{\sqrt{v\cdot{}v}}\]

<p>Let’s add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">normalize()</code> to both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ray</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vf3d</code>:</p>

  <p>Running our project now you’ll see the checkerboard pattern continue off to the horizon - <em>however</em>, it appears
further up on the canvas than you might expect. <em>Additionally</em>, the checkerboard pattern gets very garbled as the
checks gets smaller than a single pixel, creating a sort of unexpected and disorienting moire pattern. Perhaps drawing
surfaces <em>that</em> far away isn’t good…</p>

  <p><em>Coming soon: a screenshot.</em>
<!-- TODO: ![Plane.]() --></p>

</div>

<p>To remedy this, we’ll add the concept of Fog. We already have a Fog color, for when a ray doesn’t hit anything. This new
concept applies the idea of there being some extreme translucency to the nothingness between a ray’s origin and the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shape</code> it intersects with. We’ll begin by adding two new constants, one to define the maximum distance at which an
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shape</code> would be visible, and the other as the reciprocal of that.</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Fog distance and reciprocal (falloff).</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now when we’re determining the color of a ray in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SampleRay</code> we can check if the intersection distance is greater than
that of the max Fog distance. If so, we’ll immediately return the Fog color and skip further calculation. If the
distance is lower, however, we want to smoothly transition between the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shape</code>’s color and the Fog’s color, depending on
the distance.</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Quick check - if the intersection is further away than the furthest Fog point,</span>

<p>To do this, we’ve referenced a function called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lerp</code> - short for “linear interpolation” - that we haven’t defined yet.

<!-- TODO: ![Fog.]() --></p>

</div>

<p>Note that as our scene and renderer grow in complexity we’ll begin to see lower and lower frame-rates when running our
project. Switching our compilation mode to Release and running without debugging can help, as the compiler will more
aggressively apply optimizations. Feel free to experiment with optimization strategies in the Release compilation
settings.</p>

<h2 id="prettying-up">Prettying Up</h2>

<h3 id="add-reflections">Add reflections</h3>

<p>Reflections are an intrinsic feature of any raytracer. To begin, let’s add a new constant to control just how many times
a ray may reflect as it makes its way through the scene. Imagine being inside a hall of mirrors - the reflections may
continue to some recursive depth - in real life, this is infinite (or at least to the degree allowed by the quality of
the mirrors and available light). In our project, reflections add more computational complexity, so limiting the degree
to which these reflections propagate is essential. To do so, I’ve surrounded two different values for this constant in
preprocessor “if” statements to provide different values under Debug and Release mode respectively.</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">#ifdef DEBUG
</span><span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">BOUNCES</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="cp">#endif
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next we’ll add a property to our base <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shape</code> class - a floating point representing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reflectivity</code>. This will range
between 0 (no reflections) and 1 (a perfect mirror). We’ll also initialize this as a constructor parameter, and extend
that parameter to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sphere</code> class as well.</p>

<p>Lastly, we’ll add a new abstract method to our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shape</code> class that will return the normal at a given

<p>To simplify some upcoming features, let’s replace our use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">olc::Pixel</code> with our own color type. Since we’re used to
representing color as the combination of three values - red, green, and blue - we can represent each with a floating
point value between 0 and 1.</p>

<p>Looking at our code, we already have a type to represent three floating point values: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vf3d</code>. Using a simple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">using</code>
alias, we can create a type alias called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">color3</code> that is really a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vf3d</code> behind the scenes. This aliasing isn’t really
necessary, but it will help avoid confusion. Additionally, we can leverage the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">olc::PixelF</code> type to convert our
floating point color to one compatible with PixelGameEngine.</p>

<p>Let’s add a single point light source to our scene. We’ll add a member to our game class to represent this. We’ll use a
class member instead of a constant so that we can change the position of the light later. We’ll initialize this value in
the constructor to be 500 units behind and 500 units above our origin.</p>

<p>Diffuse lighting is frighteningly simple - we already know that a dot product between two vectors returns a value that
roughly describes the similarity of the vectors. To implement simple diffuse lighting, we can multiply our sample color
by a dot product between the surface normal vector and a vector pointing towards our single light source.</p>

<p>Let’s add a section to our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SampleRay</code> function after we apply reflections where we’ll apply diffuse lighting. The
process only requires three lines of code! First we’ll create a normalized ray at the intersection point, pointing
towards the light point (we do this by subtracting the light point from the intersection point). Secondly, we’ll
calculate the dot product between our light ray and the surface normal we already have.</p>

  <p>Running our project now will highlight a problem: the top halves of our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shape</code>s look correct (towards the light), but
the bottoms have a corrupted look. You’ll remember that the dot product of two vectors lies in the range \([-1,1]\). As we
reach the side of our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shape</code>s pointing away from the light, our dot product enters the negative range - and “negative”
colors are certainly a concept our data types are unprepared to handle! To fix this let’s clamp the dot product value to
the range \([0,1]\) - this way all negative values are discarded.</p>

<h3 id="add-shadow-casting">Add shadow casting</h3>

<p>Let’s upgrade our lighting mechanic with proper shadows. The theory is simple: we check if any <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shape</code>s intersect with
the ray between a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shape</code>’s surface and the light itself. If any <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shape</code>s do intersect, then the light is fully occluded
and we can set the lighting to full-dark (rather than the diffuse value we calculated last time). If there are no
intersecting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shape</code>s, then we use the dot product as we did last time.</p>

<p>To start, instead of normalizing our lighting ray immediately, we’ll want to save its length - this lets us know how far
away the light is from the current hit point. To do this we’ll add a short method to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vf3d</code> to calculate its length.</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Return the length of this vf3d.</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, to avoid the lighting ray intersecting with the current object itself we’ll offset the light ray origin by a tiny
amount along the surface normal. Finally, we’ll normalize the light ray’s direction.</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// ---✂--- In SampleRay(), replace our current diffuse lighting with the following:</span>

<h3 id="add-multisampling">Add multisampling</h3>

<p>One very noticeable shortcoming of our current renderer is the strong aliasing - since we always cast our ray towards
the exact center of every pixel, we don’t get any sort of antialiasing effect for pixels that are only partially covered
by a given <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shape</code> or feature such as shadows or reflections.</p>

<p>An easy antialiasing solution is to implement multisampling, which is the process of sending multiple rays into each
pixel and averaging the results. By varying the angle of each ray slightly we can average out aliasing error.</p>

<p>Let’s add a constant to define how many samples we’ll take for each pixel.</p>

<div class="language-cpp highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">constexpr</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">SAMPLES</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, as we iterate over the rows and columns of our canvas, let’s instead create an array of colors the same size as
our number of samples, and for each index in this array we’ll generate a random offset in the X and Y dimensions, and
add that to our previous ray direction. Finally, we’ll use the standard library’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">accumulate</code> function to sum these
colors together, and then we’ll divide the resulting color by the number of samples, effectively averaging our array.</p>

  <p>Running our project now will display a multisampled scene. <strong>However</strong>, note that since we calculate our sample
offsets randomly the edges of different features will flicker frame to frame as the average is recalculated.</p>

</div>

<p>To remedy this, we can increase the number of samples, though this increases the number of rays we need to calculate,
and so slows down our frame times. I’ve placed my constant defining the number of samples within the same preprocessor
if as my reflection count to help keep debug runs at an acceptable pace.</p>

But with that dream accompanied another thought: raytracers are nearly a pure expression of math, a discipline I am poorly qualified for. However this winter I discovered a new programming community, OneLoneCoder, and its leader, javidx9. Watching the videos produced by javidx9 inspired me to take a leap of faith in myself and start this raytracing project. The result has been amazing to see unfold as I developed first a working prototype in C#, then in C++, and finally as I produced what hopefully is an easy to follow “tutorial” style Git repository. So, lets dive in!]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://sidneys1.github.io/images/2022-03-23-raytracing/hero.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://sidneys1.github.io/images/2022-03-23-raytracing/hero.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
